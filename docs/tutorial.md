# Tutorial

In this section we will be building a simple application using Edgy Guardian and for that we will
be using [Esmerald](https://esmerald.dev) as a framework since it uses it gives a lot of the
boilerplate we can use to speed up.

You are free to ignore the use of Esmerald if your preferred framework is something else, like
FastAPI, Starlette, Litestar, Sanic, Quartz...

The same principle is still applied.
